= Introduction =

Libcrafter is a high level library for C++ designed to facilitate the creation and 
decoding of network packets. It is able to craft or decode packets of most 
common networks protocols, send them on the wire, capture them and match 
requests and replies.
It enables the creation of networking tools in a few lines with a interface 
very similar to [http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/ Scapy]. 
A packet is  described as layers that you stack one upon the other. Fields of 
each layer have useful default values that you can overload.

The library is designed to be used in multithreaded programs where you can 
combine several tasks simultaneously. For example, you can easily design 
something that sniffs, mangles, and sends at the same time you are doing 
an ARP-Spoofing attack.
It also contains a very naive implementation of the TCP/IP stack (fragmentation 
is no handled yet) at user level that enables working with TCP streams. This 
facilitates the creation of tools for data injection on arbitrary connections, IP spoofing and TCP/IP session hijacking. 

= Installation =

The installation of the library in your system should be quite straightforward.
First download the latest release of the library from the download tab or the 
command line:

$ wget http://libcrafter.googlecode.com/files/crafter-0.1.tar.gz

Extract the source code:

$ tar xfvz crafter-0.1.tar.gz
$ cd crafter-0-1

Before configuring and compiling libcrafter you need lipcap an libnet installed 
in your system. On debian based distros, you should execute:


$ sudo apt-get install libnet1 libnet1-dev libpcap0.8 libpcap0.8-dev


Configure: 


$ ./configure


Compile: 


$ make


Install on your system: 


$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig


Finally, you can download some examples codes and test them:


wget http://libcrafter.googlecode.com/files/examples.tar.gz
